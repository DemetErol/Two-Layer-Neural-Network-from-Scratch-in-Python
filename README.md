# Two-Layer-Neural-Network-from-Scratch-in-Python

dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris

1. Importing dataset, create training and test splits, read in features and labels (class/species) etc.
2. Initializing the Network weights and biases (random normal distribution on start)
3. Computing forward propagation
4. Computing backpropagation
5. Updating weights and bias
6. Repeating steps 2 to 4 for n many iterations (epochs)
